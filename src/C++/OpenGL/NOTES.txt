Here are some comments I have for the folders listed in this directory:

 1) using immediate calls to draw a heart.
 2) converted the multi-argument immediate calls to functions using arrays instead.
 3) added a constant rotation around a Z-axis.
 4) using a vertex array to draw a heart.
 5) used "glDrawElements(...)".
 6) used "glMultiDrawElements(...)".
 7) play with Vertex Buffer Objects (PENDING)
 8) used frustum, rotated the heart, and added a plate under it.
 8a) small resolution.
 9) the heart now shows up in four separate panes.
 10) special function exists to setup the camera before drawings.
 11) displays multiple different view angles in the four panes.

Some notes.

 a) Use the following command: "gcc x/*.c -lGL -lglfw -lGLEW", and replace x
    with the folder name.
