Welcome to my arcade.
Most of the following games are written in a combination of C++ and raylib.
Feel free to dev or play, and enjoy your stay!

-----
COMMANDS I USE:
g++ src/snek.cpp -lraylib

-----

DONE
- snek   : a simple snake implementation
- gol    : Conway's game of life
- vector : a vector renderer

PLANNED
- tetris : everyone knows this one!
- saper  : minesweeper
- gobang : line 'em up, but probably fewer stones than 5
- reversi
- shogi  : maybe with variants! ...but that's a long term goal!
- render : a more advanced, triangle renderer with depth

...and hopefully many more to come.
